AppletCatcert DI
================

This is a modified version of the applet offered by Catcert (http://www.catcert.cat). It is based on version 2.0.0 
which was (as far as I know) the latest version in which the source code was publicly downloadble without former request.

New feaures in 2.0.0
====================

New parameter (show_content) for showing / hidding the content to sign. It is userful for end user due to now, they are 
not completelty sure what are signing.
It is recommended to use in conjunction with "appletLogo" set to "".
